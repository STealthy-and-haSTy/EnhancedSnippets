EnhancedSnippets is a simple package that extends and enhances the
Snippet system in Sublime Text to include:

- Snippets as text files with YAML front matter instead of using XML
- Snippets can be made available not only scope but also by filename
- The ability to add your own custom variables to snippets via plugins
- Field values can be chosen from a custom, multiple choice list


NOTE: This package is still under development and does not yet contain
      all of the features that I would like to add, but is still
      functional. If you find any problems or have any additional
      feature suggestions, please report them at:
        https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/EnhancedSnippets/issues

Quick Start
-----------

Use "Tools > Enhanced Snippets > New Enhanced Snippet..." from the
menu or the Command Palette to create a new snippet template. This
works similar to the internal command for creating a new snippet
template.

The fields available in the YAML frontmatter (all OPTIONAL) are:

 - "tabTrigger": the text to trigger the snippet via AutoComplete
 - "description": descriptive text; visible in AC and the Command Palette
 - "scope": the snippet only expands in this scope
 - "glob": the snippet only expanding in files that match this spec
 - "options": multiple choice values for specific fields

Optional are in the form:

    options:
      - field: 2
        placeholder: "possible values for field 2"
        values:
          - "an enhanced snippet"
          - text: "a second optional value"
            details: "the second value in the list"

This specifies two options for the ${2} field, one being plain text
with no description and one being text with extra description.

When the snippet expands and lands on the second field, a quick panel
is displayed to prompt you for the choice.


Additional Variables
--------------------

EnhancedSnippets comes with the following additional variables that
can be used in your snippet expansions:

 - ${DATE} will insert the current date and time
 - ${CLIPBOARD} will insert the text currently on the clipboard
 - ${BUZZWORD} will insert some buzzword compliant Lorem Ipsum

Adding additional variables is possible via plugins, but this is not
currently documented; see the source code for examples if you're
curious.
